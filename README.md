# Obstacle Avoidance using Pedro Pathing

## Research
* Communicate with "Strings | 30003" on Discord
* SLAM and OpenCV

## Goals:
* Find a better name for this tool
* First milestone: hesitation. Robot stops autonomous pathing until it's clear; uses only java for simplicity
* End goal: Path regen fully, based on obstacle velocity
* PedroPathing support or dependency
* Webcam + Limelight 3a support
* RoadRunner or custom pathing support?

## Algorithm:
* 1
* Greyscale
* FAST
* 4
* 5
